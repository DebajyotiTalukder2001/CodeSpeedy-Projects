Fetch Details from a Phone No. using Python:

This is a Tool built using Python which can fetch details like Region, Time Zone, Carrier and Validity of a given Phone No. I have used the Python module 'phonenumbers' for fetching details from a given Phone No. and I have also used libraries like 
'geocoder', 'carrier', 'timezone' to get Region, Time Zone, Carrier and Validity of a given Phone No. It is a very helpful Tool
 for fetching information from a given Phone no. or to track an unknown Phone No.
