Detailed Description:

This is a Message Security Tool built using Python and ML. This Tool can ensure a secure environment where messages are sent between users and uses a combination of encryption and authentication. The messages are encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm, and the identity of the recipient is verified using username, password and an a two-factor authentication system.

This method is implemented using Python and ML. The encryption and decryption of the messages is handled by the cryptography library, and the two-factor authentication system is implemented using the Python pyotp & qrcode library. Also, the initial authentication of the user based on username and password is implemented using Pandas Library which is a popular python machine learning library. Also, to import CSV file Python CSV Library is used.


After initial verification of user based on username and password using Pandas Library, to add more security 2-Factor Authentication method is used. We can use any 2-Factor Authenticator App like Google 2-Factor Authenticator or Microsoft 2-Factor Authenticator App or their Google Chrome extensions. 


Technologies:

Language: Python
Libraries: qrcode, pyotp, CSV, cryptography
Platform: Visual Studio Code



IDE used:  Visual Studio Code (Windows X-64, Version 1.79).

Installation of Libraries:
Pyotp and qrcode library for 2-factor authentication:

Open Terminal > Type the following command:

pip install pyotp
pip install qrcode

CSV library

No need to install. It is a built-in library of Python.

cryptography library

Open Terminal > Type the following command:

pip install cryptography
Pandas library

Open Terminal > Type the following command:

pip install pandas


How to Use:

1. Go to the Project Folder where the corresponding python file is saved.

2. Right Click > Open in Terminal > Enter in Terminal : python filename.py 

For example, python secure_message.py

3. Enter username, password and Code generated by 2-Factor authentication App.

4. If user is valid, then the user can decrypt and read the message otherwise the user will be considered invalid.
