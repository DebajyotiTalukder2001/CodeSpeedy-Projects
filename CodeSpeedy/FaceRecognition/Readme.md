<h1>Face Recognition Tool using Python:</h1>

This is a Face Recognition Tool built using Python. It can compare two photos and check if both images have the same face. I have used
python libraries OpenCV, Dlib and face_recognition which can efficiently give the output whether both the images have same face.
