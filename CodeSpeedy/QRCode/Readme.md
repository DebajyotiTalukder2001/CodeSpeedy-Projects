QR Code generator and Decoder Using Python:

This is a QR Code generator and decoder tool built using Python. It can generate QR Code of any URL and can also decode any QR code.
I have used the python library 'qrcode' for generation of QR Code and 'opencv-python' for decoding the QR Code. 
I have also used another python library 'Pillow' to show the generated QR Code Image after successful generation.
